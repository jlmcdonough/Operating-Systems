\section{Problem One}
Matt Smith: a great Doctor, or the greatest Doctor? Bonus: What about Jodie? Double bonus: Who's next?
\begin{quote}

    To preface this response, I am assuming this is based on the show Doctor Who as Dr. Labouseur is very much into science fiction. Having never seen the show, I will base my answers of an article on space.com (https://www.space.com/doctor-who-doctors-ranked-worst-to-best) from October 18, 2021. It was written by a  Bobby Wells and why would someone ever lie on the internet. Would not make sense, therefore whatever it says here is true. 
    
    It ranks Matt Smith as the 6th best, therefore not the greatest, but also not not great. 
    
    Jodie Whittaker is at 5th, therefore is greater than Matt Smith, but still not the greatest.  
    
    Now this who is next question is unclear - who is the next Doctor Who, or who is the next best?
    
    To answer the latter first, Jon Pertwee is 4th, ahead of both Smith and Whittaker.
    Now onto the former, space.com seems to  be really interested in Doctor Who as of late and claimed on October 28th, 2021 (https://www.space.com/who-should-be-the-next-doctor-who) that Olly Alexander is the favority to be the next Doctor Who.
